The first thing that is important to understand is what RoboCup is.

# History and Goals
.pull-left[
* Started in 1997 with the goal of propelling AI and robotics research forward


* To achieve this, the goal to beat the 2050 world cup football champions with robots was set


* Modelled on similar successful endevours, such as IMB beating the chess world chmpion

* Since 1997 a competition has been held every year, with increasingly more powerful technology

There was an unofficial test run in 1996

## HELIOS Player 3 Landmarks

# Interactive data table showing one of the files
source(here::here("read-utils.R"))
read_landmarks("HELIOS", 3) %>%

  filter(number_time != 0) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable("html") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped")

```

???
* for each player we have
			* One sheet showing landmarks angles and distances
			* One sheet showing other player angles and distances
		  * And one ground truth sheet for player positions
There is also one universal landmark coordinate sheet which is the same accross all games

* Identifying where a player is on the field at any given time
* Based on landmarks



As you can see based on the data, a lot of information about the surroundings is given, but the exact location is not. 

In the same way that a real player needs to figure out where they are based on their surroundings, our agents have to as well

* Once we know where we are, where is everyone else?
* Using players as reference points instead of flags.

# Mathematical Localisation

## Trigonometry
If we have the distances between the player and the landmarks, along with the angles between the landmarks relative to the player, **Sine Rule** and **Cosine Rule** can be used to get all of the dimensions of triangle formed. 

----

## Vector algebra
Using the rotation matrix:

$$M = \begin{pmatrix}cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta)\\\ sin(\theta) & cos(\theta)\end{pmatrix}$$

The bearing of the player from a flag can be found.

# Neural Networks

Neural networks learn function mappings based on training data. 

They can pick up on patterns that aren't immediately obvious and take into account past values.

# Neural Networks for Localisation
* Decrease error through taking into account error differences

* Taking into account previous values in order to predict the current value

# Neural Networks for Positioning

* Track player movement and learn programmed patterns

* Predict for un-observed players
