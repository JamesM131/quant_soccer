  Yart provides an RMarkdown template for rendering TeX based PDFs. It provides a format suitable for academic settings. The typical RMarkdown variables may be used. In additiion, some variabels useful for academic reports have been added such as name of referee, due date, course title, field of study, addres of author, and logo, and a few more maybe. In addition, paper format (eg., paper size, margins) may be adjusted; the babel language set of Latex is supported. Those variables are defined in the yaml header of the yart document. Adjust those variables to your need. Note that citations, figure/ table referencing is possible due to the underlying pandoc magic. This template is not much more than setting some of the variables provided by rmarkdown (pandoc, knitr, latex, and more), credit is due to the original authors. Please reade the rmarkdown documentation for detailled information on how to use rmarkdown and how to change settings.

# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

## Literature/Previous Approaches

### Geometric vs Neural networks
For two flags the geometric approach should perform better and for more than this the neural networks should perform better. 

## Further Description of Data
### Nature
### Data Cleaning

## Core research questions
### 1. something
### 2. something else


# ERror Reporting / success definitions
## What would success look like

# Results
## What is expected
## What did we see

# Discussion
## What does this mean

# Future work
It is possible to vary the values of the input variables to observe the effects on the outputs and then comment on the ecplainability. This woyld be a food way to extend on the work that has veen done.
